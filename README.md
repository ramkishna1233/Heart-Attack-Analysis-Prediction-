# Heart-Attack-Analysis-Prediction-
This dataset contains information about people and there chances of having a heart stroke.
Dataset Information:
age - Age of the patient
sex - Sex of the patient
cp - Chest pain type ~ 0 = Typical Angina, 1 = Atypical Angina, 2 = Non-anginal Pain, 3 = Asymptomatic
trtbps - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol - Cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) ~ 1 = True, 0 = False
restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results ~ 0 = Normal, 1 = ST-T wave normality, 2 = Left ventricular ### hypertrophy
thalachh - Maximum heart rate achieved
oldpeak - Previous peak
slp - Slope
caa - Number of major vessels
thall - Thalium Stress Test result ~ (0,3)
exng - Exercise induced angina ~ 1 = Yes, 0 = No
output - target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
## Description:

age - age in years sex - (1 = male; 0 = female) cp - chest pain type trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) restecg - resting electrocardiographic results thalach - maximum heart rate achieved exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)
